You pick a gif and it displays on the screen

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

5. Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) will be displayed.
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

6. The form on the page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the array of buttons.
